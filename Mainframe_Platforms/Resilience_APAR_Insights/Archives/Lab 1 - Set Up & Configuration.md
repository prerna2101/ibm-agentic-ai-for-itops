# Lab 1 - Set Up & Configuration
## Resilience Apar Insights Agents using IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK

Kick off by preparing your Python virtual environment and installing the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK). You’ll reserve your lab environment through IBM TechZone and connect it to your CLI for hands-on development.

# Set Up & Configuration Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1 – Install Python 3.11+
*We need a compatible Python version because the watsonx Orchestrate ADK relies on modern language features and libraries that are only supported in Python 3.11 or higher*.

Make sure **Python 3.11 or above** (up to 3.13) is installed. 
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Step 2 – Clone the Repository

In your terminal enter the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.ibm.com/ibm-us-fsm-ce/AgenticAIforITOps.git
```

*Cloning the repo gives you access to all the pre-built scripts, YAML files, and configurations required for agent creation and orchestration.*

---

### Step 3 – Navigate into the Project Folder

To ensure you are in the correct place, in your terminal enter the following:

```bash
cd AgenticAIforITOps/Resilience APAR Insights/
```
---

### Step 4 – Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

In your terminal now enter: 

```bash
python -m venv envadk
source envadk/bin/activate
```
*A virtual environment isolates dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects and ensuring a clean setup for the ADK.*

---

### Step 5 – Install and Validate ADK

Enter the following commands into your terminal:

```bash
pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
pip install --upgrade ibm-watsonx-orchestrate

orchestrate --version
```
*Installing the watsonx Orchestrate ADK provides the core tools for building and managing agents.*

### Step 6 – Add Your Environment

1. Go to https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations  
2. Under watsonx Orchestrate Trial/Standard plan, click Open this environment.

4. Ensure you are in same IBM Cloud Account as indicated in the Techzone reservation.    
In the hamburger menu in the top left click to open the Resource List, expand AI / Machine Learning, and click on the Watson Orchestrate-itz resource.

5. Run the following command in your terminal with the information on the Orchestrate landing page to add your environment.
Replace `<service-instance-url>` with your Watsonx Orchestrate URL and `<name>` with any name (e.g., Itops):
```bash
orchestrate env add -n <name> -u <service-instance-url>
```

### Step 8 – Activate Environment
Generate an API key using the instructions (upto step 8) on this page section IBM Cloud:
https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/environment/production_import#ibm-cloud

Run the following command to activate your environment.  
```bash
orchestrate env activate <name>
```
You will be prompted to enter your WXO API key.
