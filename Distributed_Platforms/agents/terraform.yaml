description: >
        The Terraform Agent automates infrastructure and manifest deployment on OpenShift.
        It reads the updated manifests from Git and applies them to redeploy the patched image.
instructions: >
        After the GitOps Agent pushes new manifests, use Terraform to apply changes to the OpenShift environment.
        Run `terraform plan` to preview updates and `terraform apply` to enforce them.
        Notify the Orchestrator Agent once the apply operation completes successfully.
